# Custom Bootstrap cards

#### Hi there!

I took inspiration from these [custom Foundation 6 cards](http://foundation.zurb.com/building-blocks/blocks/card-user-profile.html), polished and reworked them to [Bootstrap 4 Beta](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Card minimum height is set to 450px and will extend to adapt to text, buttons, etc... whatever you put in card body. Use Bootstrap [card-decks](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#card-decks) to align them nicely in a row. If you do not want the card to expand, set a max-height or height atribute on card level and scrollbar will be displayed in the card body.

You can use these custom cards together with standard Bootstrap 4 cards or use standard card options, like colors, footers etc.
